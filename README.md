mintbean hackathon - game - August 2021

### Live site

### Deployment

If you are wanting to run on local, clone the repo and open the main html file (not the html within the game folder). 
This will automatically take you to the home page where you can then navigate to the game, our personal websites and linkedin pages
or to Zim, which was used to aid in this project

NOTE: If you open the console while testing, the answer to each question is displayed for ease of testing

### Development

Web and frontend development is a new area, and games are a completely unfamiliar area for us, so this is a pretty simple
html/css/bootstrap/javascript based project with the use of Zim (https://zimjs.com/index.html)
